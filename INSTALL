INSTALL: OpenPlugin
=======================

INSTALLATION

To install OpenPlugin, type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Please Note: If you receive any errors during the installation of OpenPlugin,
please see the "KNOWN INSTALLATION PROBLEMS" section below.

OpenPlugin has a number of drivers available for installation.  It is often
unnecessary or too time consuming to install all of them.  For that reason,
OpenPlugin allows you to pick and choose which drivers you wish to install
dependencies for.  When you run the above 'perl Makefile.PL', you will be given
a menu to help you install drivers for which you do not already have
dependencies installed on your system.

At any time, you can go back and run the Makefile.PL to install more drivers.

KNOWN INSTALLATION PROBLEMS

* Digest::SHA1

The File driver for the Cache Plugin requires Digest::SHA1 version 2.02.
Unfortunatly, Digest::SHA1 fails to compile on certain systems -- notably,
RedHat 8.0.  If you don't think you need the Cache Plugin, just remove the
"File" driver from the list of drivers to install when you're at the OpenPlugin
Installation Screen.  Currently, this is the only driver available for the
Cache Plugin.  Feel free to write more :-)

* Apache::Session

The Apache::Session module is needed in order for Sessions to work, it's
currently the only supported Session driver.  Installation of this fails on
many RedHat 8.0 and 9 systems.  It gives several errors, including:

  t/99dbfile.........Use of uninitialized value in subroutine entry

  Could not open dbm file: No such file or directory

I have found that forcing the install of this module works fine.

* XML::DOM

The XML::DOM module is required for Log::Log4perl.  On RedHat 8.0 and 9, the
installation of this module fails with the following message:

  t/dom_jp_print........FAILED test 2

This appears to be a known issue with XML::DOM, though a fix is not yet
available.  Due to the way OpenPlugin interacts with Log4perl, the XML::DOM
module will actually go unused.  I would just force the install of XML::DOM,
and hope they come out with a fix for this soon :-)  Doing that does work fine
for me.
