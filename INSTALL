INSTALL: OpenPlugin
=======================

INSTALLATION

To install OpenPlugin, type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

OpenPlugin has a number of drivers available for installation.  It is often
unnecessary or too time consuming to install all of them.  For that reason,
OpenPlugin allows you to pick and choose which drivers you wish to install
dependencies for.  When you run the above 'perl Makefile.PL', you will be given
a menu to help you install drivers for which you do not already have
dependencies installed on your system.

At any time, you can go back and run the Makefile.PL to install more drivers.
