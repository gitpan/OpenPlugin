=head1 NAME

OpenPlugin::Request::CGI - CGI driver for the OpenPlugin::Request plugin

=head1 PARAMETERS

You may optionally pass in an existing CGI object.  For example:

 my $q = CGI->new();
 my $OP = OpenPlugin->new( request => { cgi => $q } );

This is typically unnecessary.  If you do not pass in a CGI object, one will be
created for you.

After the plugin is initialized, the CGI object is accessible
to you using:

 $q = $OP->request->object();
