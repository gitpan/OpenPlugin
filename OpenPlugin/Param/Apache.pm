=head1 NAME

OpenPlugin::Param::Apache - Apache driver for the OpenPlugin::Param plugin

you won't actually pass in parameters to this plugin, but to the request
plugin.  See the L<Request|OpenPlugin::Request> plugin for more information.

=head1 CONFIG OPTIONS

Apache

As this is a child plugin of the Request plugin, the configuration of this
plugin should be embedded within the configuration for the Request plugin.
Additionally, if you wish to use this driver for this plugin, then you must
also enable this driver under the Request plugin.
